# Student API

This repository contains a **Postman collection** for performing CRUD operations on a Student API. The project was created as part of learning API development and API testing using **Postman**. The backend is built using **Go (Golang)**.

## üìù Description

The **Student API Postman Collection** demonstrates the following HTTP operations on the Student resource:

- **Create** (POST)
